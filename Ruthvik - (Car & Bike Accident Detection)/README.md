# YOLOv11-Based Car and Bike Accident Detection System in Google Colab

## Introduction and Overview

This project utilizes YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to identify car and bike accidents in various contexts, including images and videos. YOLOv11 offers advancements in detection accuracy, speed, and scalability, making it ideal for real-time applications in traffic monitoring and accident analysis.

## Project Implementation

### 1)Dataset Preparation
A curated dataset of images and videos containing car and bike accidents is collected.

### 2)Model Configuration
The base model, such as yolo11n.pt, is chosen for its speed and accuracy balance.The model configuration file is modified to include car and bike classes in the detection categories.

### 3)Training and Validation
The model is trained on the prepared dataset using a deep learning framework like PyTorch.Loss functions like Intersection over Union (IoU) are used to optimize bounding box localization and classification accuracy for car and bike objects.

### 4)Inference and Testing
#### The trained YOLOv11 model is used for:
Image Detection: Identifying car and bike accidents in static images.
Video Analysis: Detecting accidents and providing insights from video feeds.

## Results and Performance

1)The YOLOv11 car and bike accident detection system is evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP).

2)The project aims to achieve a high level of accuracy in identifying car and bike accidents to support traffic monitoring systems and accident analysis workflows.

## Example Use Cases

1)Assisting law enforcement with accident scene analysis.

2)Real-time accident detection for improved traffic management.

3)Data collection for accident pattern analysis and prevention strategies.
